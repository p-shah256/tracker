I need an ATS-optimized resume tailored for this job. Response MUST be valid YAML using snake_case fields.

JOB DATA: %s

RESUME SECTIONS: %s

OPTIMIZATION RULES:
1. SURGICALLY insert JD keywords into EXISTING technical achievements - don't add fluff
2. Every bullet MUST contain quantifiable metrics (maintain the original numbers)
3. Keep each bullet CONCISE and FOCUSED - no tacking on generic skill statements
4. DO NOT mention soft skills like "quick learner" or "interpersonal" directly - show them through achievements
5. Keywords should appear natural in context, NOT forced or stuffed

FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- ALL strings with special chars (like **) MUST use double quotes
- Example: technical_skills: ["**Languages:** Python, C++"]

BAD EXAMPLE:
Original: "Engineered image processing pipeline using Docker reducing time by 73%"
Bad: "Engineered image processing pipeline using Docker reducing time by 73%, showcasing computer science and networking skills and demonstrating quick learner capabilities"

GOOD EXAMPLE: 
Original: "Engineered image processing pipeline using Docker reducing time by 73%"
Good: "Engineered TCP/IP-optimized image processing pipeline using Docker and Linux microservices reducing processing time by 73% across distributed networks"
