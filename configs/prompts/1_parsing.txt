      "level": int  // experience years
    },
    "skills": [

        "name": string,
        "type": string,       // "technical", "soft", "domain"
        "priority": number,   // 1-5 scale

        "yearsRequired": number | null,

}

Key Rules:
1. Level calculation: explicit years > highest skill requirement > implied (senior=8+, mid=4-7, junior=0-3)
2. Split compound skills into separate entries
3. Priority based on position, emphasis, language strength
4. Include skills implied in responsibilities
5. Always preserve original context
